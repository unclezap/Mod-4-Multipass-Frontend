# Multipass Quiz *(Front End)*
**A React Project by [Chris Wagstaffe](https://github.com/agandaur-ii), [Joe Avila](https://github.com/javila35), and [Zeb Blackwell](https://github.com/unclezap)**

**[Back End Repository](https://github.com/unclezap/multipass)**

 
## Installing Locally
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Fork and clone the back end repository. *[Located here](https://github.com/unclezap/multipass)* 
    * *I would suggest having one parent directory, with a sub directory for the front end and back end.*
3. Navigate to the front end directory in your terminal, and run ``` npm install ```. This will create a ```package-lock.json``` file.
    * To get full functionality of the website your rails server needs to be running.
4. After setting up back-end, run ```npm start``` from your terminal to access the app.
